# Trading_Algorithms
A collection of trading strategies implemented in Python

- dmac.py implements the Dual Moving Average Crossover strategy, which buys shares when the Short Moving Average moves above the Long Moving Average,
and sells when the reverse happens. dmac.py includes methods for optimizing the short and long window (in number of days) based on past data, profit
calculation, and vizualization to see decisions the algorithm is making.

- kde.py will implement kernel regression to predict future stock prices
